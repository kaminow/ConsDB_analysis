# ConsDB_analysis
Scripts to re-create the analysis from the original ConsDB paper, starting with the stock genome FASTA and GTF files.

After adjusting the Makefile accordingly, you can just run `make`, and the entire analysis will run (note that this will take a long time).

More detailed instructions on running [ConsDB](https://github.com/kaminow/ConsDB) and [STAR-Consensus](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) can be found [in this Gist](https://gist.github.com/kaminow/028cdc257e3a551d981dd63130725f1e).
